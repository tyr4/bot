# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** September 14, 2024

## 1. Introduction  
This Privacy Policy describes how Silwuf ("I", "me", or "my") collects, uses, and protects information obtained from users interacting with the bot within Discord. By using the bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information I Collect  
Silwuf only interacts with users through Discord's slash commands to provide calculator and help functions. I do not collect, store, or process personal data, nor do I share any information with third parties.

- **User Commands:** The bot processes commands entered by users (e.g., calculator inputs or help requests). These commands are processed in real-time and are not stored.
- **Discord IDs:** To operate within Discord, the bot may momentarily access user IDs to execute commands.
- **Message Reaction Leaderboard** - In the official DBG server, users have a chance to get emote reactions on any message. Silwuf keeps track of the user's ID, display name and updates the counter. 

## 3. Data Retention  
I retain user data (User ID, Display Name, Avatar Image) for as long as it is necessary to provide the bot's functionality. Specifically:
- **User Data** (User ID, Display Name): This information is stored for as long as the user interacts with the bot. If a user stops interacting with the bot, they can contact me to erase the data.
- **Avatar Image**: This image is stored until the next user uses the same command which requires your Avatar Image (2), after which it updates itself.

## 4. Data Sharing  
I do not share any data with third parties, as no personal data is collected or stored.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy  
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here, and the updated policy will reflect the new effective date.

## 6. Contact Me  
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact me on Discord at _tyrael.
